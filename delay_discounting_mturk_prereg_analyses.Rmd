# Introduction

Here we analyze data collected on 210 MTurk participants according to the preregistration at [this](https://osf.io/3hrme/) osf project. Some pre-registered analyses led us to perform additional, non-specified analyses that should be considered data dependent, though these analysis choices were not made in response to _p_-values.
